# Randomized File Generator
CURRENT- PERL

TODO- PYTHON

This is my default "how to learn a new language" tool.

Prompts for users input on: min and max size range, scale of size (KB, MB, GB, TB).
Logs generation.

Currently has two commands inside: "dd" and "fallocate". "dd" is limited to the 2,147,483,647 cap of a 32-bit system and is commented out by default.
