# Randomized File Generator (python & perl)
CURRENT- PERL, PYTHON



This is my default "how to learn a new language" tool.

Prompts for users input on: min and max size range, scale of size (KB, MB, GB, TB). 
Python version also prompts for a working directory to use.

Logs generated.

Uses the "fallocate" command to build test files. Perl file has a "dd" command commented out as an option.

Use at your own risk
